tutorials for c++ 11 to develop real world application,using wtl for windows gui.

now I've implemented such futures:  
  1. a wtl simple sdi navigate framework,using toolbar switch between modeless dialog.  
  2. mvvm framework for wtl modeless dialog.  
  3. multi thread progress report,with simple lambda function,so we can test business logic,don't need pay attention to ui elements.  
  4. try to make a paser for binary files or memory block,using simple input iterator.  
  5. import quote from a binary file.  
  6. import exright files from a binary file,under same  import quote dialog,so we can switch models form view model.  
  7. a sqlite c++ 11 wrapper,which is the best wrapper now,you could find some info in dbtest.cc  
  8. comiled under vs2013,and using sqlite.
